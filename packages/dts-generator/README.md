# @ui5/DTS-Generator

This is an "internal" npm package containing the logic for generating
TypeScript signatures from SAP UI5 api.json file.

It is currently **not meant for external consumption** and is thus not published to npm and is instead
used as an **internal** dev-dependency in this mono repo.

At this time it is only used in the [@openui5/ts-types](../types) package during development flows.

In the future it **may** be used as the basis for creating a **public consumable** UI5 build chain tool
that would generate TypeScript signatures for SAP UI5 libraries.

## Support

The dts-generator package is not currently publicity published and thus no support is provided.
